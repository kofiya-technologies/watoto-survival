# WATOTO SURVIVAL

WATOTO SURVIVAL is an open source project that utilizes classical survival analysis methods in R, including Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression techniques. Its primary objective is to enable researchers and graduate students to collaborate and identify risk factors related to child mortality in children under five years old. By leveraging statistical techniques and the rich dataset from DHS surveys, WATOTO SURVIVAL aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers and researchers in their efforts to address this critical issue.
